Veterans and military family members have consistently proven themselves to be the most reliable, independent, and hardworking team members. Additionally, Veterans have soft skills such as problem solving and creativity that can benefit a companyâ€™s bottom line. By signing up and [making a commitment](/employment/users/sign_in), your company will stand out to candidates eager to enter the civilian workforce.  

You can regularly update your profile with the number of hires made. You can also share that number publicly.
